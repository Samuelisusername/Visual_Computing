# Compress Images of Faces using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)


By eliminating the least significant set of Eigenvectors in the SVD of the image matrix, we compress the image of faces. 


We can decompress images of faces by taking the eigenface and adding a the compression values times the most significant eigenvectors.
